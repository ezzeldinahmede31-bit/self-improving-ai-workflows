# agent-reach

Installed channels only. Run `agent-reach doctor` first if a call fails; a channel can be
installed but unauthenticated.

Every command returns the same envelope, so the output shape does not change per channel.
Use `--max-tokens` whenever the source could be long.

```
agent-reach get <channel>.<command> <query> [--max-tokens N] [--limit N] [--json]
```

## Channels

### rss

Read any RSS or Atom feed as clean text.

- `agent-reach get rss.feed <query>`

### youtube

Video metadata and transcripts, via yt-dlp.

- `agent-reach get youtube.transcript <query>`
- `agent-reach get youtube.info <query>`
